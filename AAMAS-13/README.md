AAMAS-13-Experiments
=============================================

These are the codes used in the paper [Benchmarking Communication in Actor- and Agent-Based Languages](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2485176). All of the codes for Scenarios 1 and 2 are for the configuration N = 500 000. For the other configurations simply change the appropriate values for each code.

PS. Don't forget to update Jason codes 'basedir' value at line 2 build.xml with a correct path to the base directory where that build.xml for that code is. Also update jasonJar at line 10 build.xml with a correct path to the jason.jar located on your Jason install folder.
